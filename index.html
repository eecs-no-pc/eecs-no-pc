<mainsection>EECS no PC</mainsection>
  
  Not all students have access to a personal device usable for running development tools.
  However, EECS courses do not always consider this problem. I was without a laptop for a few 
  weeks during the second semester of my Junior year while it was being repaired, and it was 
  stressful trying to figure out what resources were available to me while trying to meet tight 
  assignment deadlines. I wrote this guide to help students who find themselves in a similar situation.

<subsection>Campus Computing Resources</subsection>
The University of Michigan offers four main types of public devices for students to use, through three administrations. These are:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Windows PCs through Campus Computing Sites
    </li>
    <li>
      Windows PCs through CAEN
    </li>
    <li>
      macOS desktops through Campus Computing Sites 
    </li>
    <li>
      macOS desktops through the Art department 
    </li>
    <li>
      Red Hat Linux PCs through CAEN (also referred to as “CAEN” by instructors, which is confusing)
    </li>
    <li>
      Windows / macOS laptop through the <a href="https://its.umich.edu/computing/computers-software/sites-at-home">Sites @ Home Loaner Laptop Program</a>, a long term (> 1 month) laptop loaner program
    </li>
  </ul>

  Each category of computer has different software available to it, but within a category, individual machines should have identical setups. Some schools and programs may also offer free/reimbursed laptops for certain students, so keep an eye out for that option too.

  <p>
    When using any of these devices, remember that they are public computers and may not be free of security vulnerabilities and exploits. 
    So, always log out of any accounts you sign into on these devices.

<subsection>Class Notes</subsection>

<courseheader id="183">EECS 183: Elementary Programming Concepts</courseheader>
  All programming aside from the final project is in C++. <a href="#cpp">C/C++ Guide</a>. 
<courseheader id="280">EECS 280: Data Structures and Algorithms 1</courseheader>
   All programming in this class is in C++. <a href="#cpp">C/C++ Guide</a>. Note that this class asks you to run git as part of assignments, so avoid Sites PCs, since they do not have git installed. 
<courseheader id="281">EECS 281: Data Structures and Algorithms 2</courseheader>
   All programming in this class is in C++. <a href="#cpp">C/C++ Guide</a>. Note that this class asks you to run git as part of assignments, so avoid Sites PCs, since they do not have git installed.
<courseheader id="370">EECS 370: Intro to Computer Organization</courseheader>
  All programming in this class is in C. <a href="#cpp">C/C++ Guide</a>.
<courseheader id="376">EECS 376: Foundations of Computer Science</courseheader>
 There is little-to-no programming in this class. Any required coding is extremely basic and can be completed on any of the public computers except Sites PCs, unless you use the <a href="#windows-store">Windows Store exploit</a> to install python. 

 You will want a LaTEX editor, and there are some options preinstalled or available as browser apps. <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/">Overleaf</a> is a popular free web-based option.

<courseheader id="270">EECS 270: Intro to Logic Design</courseheader>
This class requires Intel Quartus, which is available on CAEN Linux.

<courseheader id="481">EECS 481: Software Engineering</courseheader>
  Ubuntu 16 is required (newer versions do not work), which no on-campus device natively supports. 
  You can make a VM on macOS devices by downloading the <a href="https://getutm.app/">UTM app</a>, and it will perform reasonably well enough. 
  Ubuntu is available in the windows store, but Ubuntu 16 specifically is no longer offered there. CAEN Windows and Linux will not work.

<courseheader id="485">EECS 485: Web Systems</courseheader>
This one’s trickier. Most of the tools you need are not preinstalled on any university-owned device, and there are many gotchas. 
  All programming in this class is in Python, see the <a href="#python">Python Guide</a>.   
  Projects 1, 2, 4, and 5 are nonetheless easy to complete with the proper setup as mentioned in the guide. Project 3 (React) is more difficult, because
  the unit tests require Java to run. It is possible to get Java without administrator, but it's annoying to set up. See the <a href="#java">Java Guide</a>.

   <courseheader id="493">EECS 493: User Interface Development</courseheader>
  This class covers purely front-end web development. You will want git and an editor like Visual Studio Code, neither of which are available
  on Sites Windows. The class is doable on those devices via notepad, but that is not recommended. 
  
  <courseheader id="494">EECS 494: Computer Game Design</courseheader>
  Multiple Unity versions are available on CAEN Windows. 
  In addition, there are Unity installs on GroundWorks macOS devices in the Duderstadt. 
  The other device types are not usable for this class, and to my knowledge you can’t bypass 
  the administrator requirement to install Unity in user space. 

<hr>
  
<subsection id="cpp">C/C++ Guide</subsection>
Coursework in these classes is easily doable on Sites Macs, Sites Windows, Art Macs, CAEN Windows, and CAEN Linux. 
You get the following software relevant to the class, preconfigured for you to use, and can follow class setup tutorials 1:1:

  <ul>
      Groundworks Macs:
    <li>
      Xcode, Instruments Profiler & related tools
    </li>
    <li>
      git
    </li>
    <li>
      lldb
    </li>
     <li>
      Apple Clang
    </li>
     <li>
      "gcc"*
    </li>
  </ul>
  Note about gcc on mac. Xcode also installs a symlink so that you can run the g++ command on Mac. However, this is <em>not</em> g++! 
  This invokes Apple Clang with a default set of arguments to emulate the real g++. The behavior of clang and gcc is different, so
  if a course asks you to use the gcc or g++ commands, do not run them on university-owned macs!

  <ul>
      Sites PCs:
    <li>
      Visual Studio Enterprise (includes CMake)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
      CAEN Windows:
    <li>
      Visual Studio Enterprise (includes: CMake)
    </li>
    <li>
      git
    </li>
    <li>
      Visual Studio Code & Windows Subsystem for Linux (more on this later)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
      CAEN Linux:
    <li>
      gcc, g++
    </li>
    <li>
      clang, clang++
    </li>
    <li>
      perf  (required for 281)
    </li>
    <li>
      nano, vim, emacs
    </li>
    <li>
      cmake
    </li>
    <li>
      git
    </li>
    <li>
      Visual Studio Code
    </li>
  </ul>

  <subsection id="python">Python Guide</subsection>
  Python is preinstalled on macOS. However, you'll likely want an IDE or other editor to help you, especially with regard to pip libraries. 
  <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm Community Edition</a> is an excellent free python IDE which also manages python virtual
  environments and pip libraries for you. Below are the steps to run it without administrator priviledges:

  <ol>
    Any Mac
    <li>
      Download the .dmg and open it
    </li>
    <li>
      Don't drag it to the Applications folder. Instead, just double-click it from the DMG window to open it. 
    </li>
  </ol>

  <ol>
    Any Windows device
    <li>
      Download the .exe installer
    </li>
    <li>
      Use 7zip to unzip the installer .exe
    </li>
    <li>
      In the folder, navigate to bin/ and run pycharm64.exe.  
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <subsection id="java">Java Guide</subsection>
  TODO
  
  <subsection id="windows-store">Windows Store Exploit</subsection>
  <p>
    <p class="warning">
      Not recommended. 
    </p>
    ITS blocks the windows store on Sites PCs. However, it takes the windows store around 30 seconds after it launches to realize
  that it is blocked, and as long as you click the "install" button within that time frame, you can install anything on the windows
  store (like Python) without admin priviledges. If you fail this quick-time event, just log out or restart the PC and try again. 
  </p>
  <p>
    On CAEN Windows, the windows store is not blocked. You can use this to install WSL and Ubuntu. 
  </p>
